    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advice my future client to use a web framework, and add security measures on top of that framework to compensate for what the framework didn't do. MDN writes: “[...] never trust data from the browser.”(2022). And further advice that “Always check and sanitize all incoming data.”(MDN. 2022). I think doing these two things will be a good starting point. 
        Further we could use Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration (CI/CD), to make sure new changes to the clients site wouldn't create new vulnerabilities. I would also advise my client of the rest of what counts as best practices in websecurity, such as authorization and authentication, Implementation of automatic user timeout etc(Noroff Web and Communications Technology, module 1, web security)</p>
