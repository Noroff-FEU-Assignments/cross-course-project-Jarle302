    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">If i were to advise my client, I think using frameworks,both web and cyber security possibly is the best advice I could give. Nidecki(2022) advices to use a cybersecurity framework. and MDN mentions several risks which are handled by web frameworks. Such as dealing with CSRF, and escaping characters to help prevent SQL injections. I would also echo MDN’s advices which is  “[...] never trust data from the browser.”(2022). MDN further advises to “Always check and sanitize all incoming data.”(MDN. 2022). As I understand it, many of the security issues listed in MDN’s article such as XSS is addressed following the mentioned advice from MDN, so i think it's a good starting point. <br>
 
      Further (taken from the literature on the module of web security) I would advise the client to make use of Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration (CI/CD), to make sure new changes to the clients site wouldn't create new vulnerabilities. I would also advise my client of the rest of what counts as best practices in websecurity, such as authorization and authentication, Implementation of automatic user timeout, network security, and if using third party applications make sure they are trustworthy, noroff suggest an easy way can be to check the weekly number of downloads the application gets.(Noroff Web and Communications Technology, module 1, web security). To summarize, I would advise my client to use frameworks and build measures on top of those frameworks to compensate for what the frameworks don't do.
