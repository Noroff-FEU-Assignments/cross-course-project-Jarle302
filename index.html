    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would first inform the client of the most common form for security risks, according to the OWASP list. Then I would advise the client to create a threat model based on the nature of the website, and in regards to the OWASP list. I will in my answer focus on XSS, CSFR and SQLI as potential threats.. 
      In general XSS is handled by sanitizing user input and MDN(2022)advises to sanitize all user input, which is advice I would echo to my client, doing so also helps prevent other threats such as directory traversal, file inclusion, command injection.(MDN,2022). It also helps against SQLI when used together with other measures such as sql prepared statements(Skoglund,2019). Skoglund(2019) recommends using a sql sanitation library, rather than trying to manually sanitize the data yourself, so I would pass his advice along to my client.CSFR as I understand is easier to deal with server side either by using a web framework, or CSRF tokens. In addition to further help against CSRF can be to have redundancy to the most important actions taken on the site, such as reauthenticating, or using CAPTCHA(Skoglund,2019). Also as mentioned in the Module about web security on Noroff. To make sure there is implemented automatic user timeout. One last general advice I would give my client is to make sure all third party applications are safe. Noroff suggests one to check this by looking at the weekly number of downloads an app has.
